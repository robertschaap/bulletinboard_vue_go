# Bulletin Board
A simple bulletin board where you can leave a message and which is populated dynamically from a database with pagination.

### Installation Notes
If you are looking to install this locally, please feel free to clone or download the repository. Modules are all included in the package.json but please note that you will need to have MongoDB installed locally as well. As this is my first simple Go playground as well, some of the Go setup (particularly on Gopath) could be suboptimal.
